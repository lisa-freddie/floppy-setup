## Competitive Landscape

**Tagline:** "The Collison Install — we show up and do it for you"

**Pricing:**
- In-person (SF Bay Area): **$2,400** — first agent + hardening + 14-day hypercare

**Target:** CEOs, CFOs, Heads of Sales at small-to-mid companies. B2B, enterprise-lite.

### GetClawHelp — getclawhelp.com
**Positioning:** Budget VPS setup for individuals, no coding required

**Pricing:**
- One-time setup: **$119** (10 skills pre-installed)
- Premium setup: **$229** (25 skills, 1 custom automation, 7-day support)
- Monthly maintenance: **$97/mo** (updates, patches, troubleshooting)

**Target:** Non-technical individuals who want OpenClaw on a VPS
**Strengths:** Low price point, simple messaging

### DIY / Self-hosting
- OpenClaw is free and open source
- DigitalOcean 1-click deploy exists
- Typical self-hosting cost: $0-50/mo (just API costs)
- But setup requires: root access, API keys, Docker, security hardening, technical expertise

## Market Gap Analysis

| Segment | SetupClaw | GetClawHelp | **Opportunity** |
|---------|-----------|-------------|-----------------|
| Enterprise/founders | ✅ | ❌ | Saturated by Michael |
| Budget individuals | ❌ | ✅ | Covered |
| **Creators/freelancers/small biz** | ❌ (too expensive) | ❌ (too basic) | **WIDE OPEN** |
| **Design-forward setup** | ❌ | ❌ | **Nobody doing this** |
| **In-person Bay Area (non-enterprise)** | ❌ (only enterprise) | ❌ | **OPEN** |
| Women/underrepresented founders | ❌ | ❌ | **OPEN** |

## Carmen's Differentiators
1. **Design background** — 10+ years product design. Nobody else is approaching this from a UX/design lens
2. **Actually uses OpenClaw daily** — not just installing it, living with it (me, Lisa, is the proof)
3. **Floppy philosophy** — ownership, anti-SaaS, accessible tools. Resonates with indie/creator crowd
4. **Bay Area in-person + remote** — same as Michael but at accessible pricing
5. **Underserved markets** — creators, freelancers, small businesses, not just VC-backed startups

## Recommended Positioning

**Don't compete with Michael on enterprise.** He has first-mover advantage and is scaling with "licensed operators."

**Own the middle market:** Creators, freelancers, solopreneurs, small businesses who want a personal AI assistant but find SetupClaw too expensive and GetClawHelp too impersonal.

**Lead with design + experience:** Carmen doesn't just install OpenClaw — she designs your AI workflow. That's the unique value.

## Suggested Pricing (competitive but accessible)

### Implementation
- **In-person (Bay Area):** $800-1,200 (undercuts Michael by 50%+)
- **Remote:** $400-600
- **Additional agent:** +$400-600

### Ongoing Support
- **Monthly care:** $200-400/mo (monitoring, updates, workflow tweaks)
- **Hourly support:** $150/hr for ad-hoc help

### Packages could include:
- OpenClaw install + security hardening
- Email/calendar/messaging integration
- Custom workflow design (this is the design differentiator)
- Personalization (SOUL.md, skills, personality)
- 7-14 day hypercare
- Optional: Mac Mini sourcing + setup (hardware at cost)

## Brand Name Ideas

### Top Picks
1. **Claw & Order** — playful, memorable, implies getting things organized. Domain: clawandorder.com
2. **SetupClaw** is taken. But similar patterns:
3. **ClawCraft** — implies artisanal, designed, crafted setup. Not just installed, *crafted*
4. **Soft Landing** — references Floppy's ethos (software you own), gentle onboarding. Domain: softlanding.ai
5. **Paw Print** — cute, memorable, plays on the "claw" animal metaphor
6. **The Claw Bar** — like a genius bar but for OpenClaw. Fun, approachable
7. **Claw House** — your AI gets a proper home. Warm, inviting
8. **Midnight Setup** — nods to Carmen's night owl energy, implies dedication
9. **Floppy Setup** — keeps it under the Floppy brand umbrella (simplest approach)
10. **OwnClaw** — emphasizes ownership (Floppy philosophy). "Your AI, actually yours."

### My recommendation: **Start under Floppy**
Use "Floppy" as the parent brand and offer this as the first Floppy service. Reasons:
- Floppy LLC is already being registered
- Builds the brand Carmen actually wants to grow
- Can always spin off later if it takes off
- Website: floppy.tools/setup or setup.floppy.tools

**Alternative if she wants it standalone:** "ClawCraft" or "OwnClaw" — both available as domains (need to verify)

## Website Scope (Ship by Friday)

### MVP Pages
1. **Landing page** — hero, what OpenClaw is, why use a pro, pricing, CTA
2. **How it works** — 3-4 step process
3. **Book a call** — Calendly or Cal.com embed

### Nice to have
- About page (Carmen's story, why she does this)
- FAQ
- Blog (for SEO later)

### Tech stack suggestion
- **Framer** or **Next.js + Vercel** — Carmen knows design tools, Framer might be fastest
- Or a simple single-page site on one of her existing domains

### Content to nail
- "I don't just install OpenClaw — I design how AI fits your life"
- Emphasize: ownership, privacy, personal, designed (not corporate)
- Show the contrast with enterprise pricing (accessible alternative)
- Social proof: Carmen's own setup (me!) as case study #1
