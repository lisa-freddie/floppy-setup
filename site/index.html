          <h2>Hi, I'm Carmen.</h2>
          <p>
            I'm a product designer with 10+ years of experience building software at companies 
            you've probably used. I've been deep in AI tooling since day one — not just following 
            the hype, but actually building with it.
          </p>
          <p>
            I run OpenClaw myself, every day. My AI assistant Lisa handles my email, manages my 
            calendar, does research, and helps me build products. I didn't just install it — I 
            designed how it works for me. That's what I'll do for you.
          </p>
          <p>
            I believe software should be something you own, not rent. That's why I started 
            <strong>Floppy</strong> — to build tools that belong to you. OpenClaw fits that 
            philosophy perfectly: your AI, your hardware, your data.

      <h2>Questions</h2>
      <div class="faq-list">
        <details class="faq-item">
          <summary>What is OpenClaw?</summary>
          <p>An open-source AI assistant that runs on your own hardware. It can manage email, calendar, messaging, run automations, do research, and much more — all while keeping your data private. Think of it as hiring a personal assistant that lives on your computer.</p>
        </details>
        <details class="faq-item">
          <summary>What hardware do I need?</summary>
          <p>A Mac Mini is ideal (and required for iMessage integration). You can also run it on a Linux server, VPS, or Raspberry Pi. I can help you source hardware at cost if you don't have anything yet.</p>
        </details>
        <details class="faq-item">
          <summary>How much does it cost to run after setup?</summary>
          <p>OpenClaw itself is free. You'll pay for the AI model API (like Claude or GPT) — typically $10-80/month depending on how much you use it. I'll help you pick the right model and optimize costs.</p>
        </details>
        <details class="faq-item">
          <summary>Is my data safe?</summary>
          <p>Your data stays on your hardware — nothing goes to a third-party server (except the AI model API calls, which are encrypted). I follow the official security hardening guide and lock everything down during setup.</p>
        </details>
        <details class="faq-item">
          <summary>How is this different from enterprise setup services?</summary>
          <p>Services like SetupClaw target enterprise teams at $2,400+ per setup with hidden pricing and sales calls. I work with individuals, freelancers, creators, and small businesses at transparent, accessible prices. I also bring a design perspective — I don't just install, I design your entire workflow and AI personality.</p>
        </details>
        <details class="faq-item">
          <summary>Can I set it up myself instead?</summary>
          <p>Absolutely — OpenClaw is open source. If you're technical and have the time, go for it. I'm here for people who want it done right without spending a weekend in the terminal.</p>
        </details>
        <details class="faq-item">
          <summary>What's "personality & soul design"?</summary>
          <p>Your AI assistant has configuration files that define how it communicates, makes decisions, and interacts with you. I craft these based on your preferences — whether you want it formal or casual, proactive or reactive, concise or detailed. It's the difference between a generic chatbot and something that feels like <em>your</em> assistant.</p>
        </details>
        <details class="faq-item">
          <summary>What if I need help after the support period?</summary>
          <p>You can add Ongoing Care ($200/mo) for continuous support, or book ad-hoc help at $100/hr whenever you need it. No lock-in, cancel anytime.</p>
